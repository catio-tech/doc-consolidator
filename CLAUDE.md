# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains Catio documentation files in PDF format. Catio appears to be an architecture observability and management platform that helps organizations visualize, manage, and optimize their technical architecture.

## Repository Structure

- `Documentation & Knowledge Base/` - Contains all PDF documentation files organized by topic
  - `Getting Started/` - Foundational concepts and setup guides
  - `Integrations/` - Integration setup and configuration guides
  - `Stacks (Architecture Observability)/` - Core platform features for architecture visualization
  - `Requirements/` - Requirements management functionality
  - `Recommendations/` - AI-driven architecture recommendations
  - `Workspace/` - Workspace management and collaboration features
  - `Frequently Asked Questions/` - FAQ organized by topic areas
  - `Catio Academy/` - Educational content and best practices
  - `Quickstart/` - Quick setup and onboarding guides

## Key Platform Components

Based on the documentation structure, Catio includes:

1. **Architecture Observability** - Infrastructure and architecture visualization tools
2. **Integration Management** - AWS, Kubernetes, VPC, and other cloud platform integrations
3. **Requirements Management** - Document and track architectural requirements
4. **AI-Powered Recommendations** - Automated suggestions for architecture improvements
5. **Collaboration Workspaces** - Team collaboration and workspace management
6. **Knowledge Base** - Educational content and best practices repository

## Development Context

This is currently a documentation-only repository. When code is added, it will likely be related to:

- Documentation processing and rendering
- Integration with the Catio platform
- Tools for managing or transforming the PDF documentation
- Web interfaces for accessing the documentation

## File Formats

All documentation is currently in PDF format with complex nested directory structures using hash-based naming conventions.
